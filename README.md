## This code performs Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on an image using the EasyOCR library. 
## **Code Explanation:**

**Importing Libraries:** The code imports necessary libraries: OpenCV (`cv2`) for image processing, EasyOCR for text detection and recognition, and Matplotlib (`plt`) for displaying images.

**Reading the Image:** It reads an image from the specified file path (`"test1.png"`) using OpenCV's `cv2.imread()` function. The image is stored in the variable `img`.

**Text Detection and Recognition:** It creates an OCR reader instance using EasyOCR's `Reader()` function. The `readtext()` method of the reader is then used to detect and recognize text in the image. The result is stored in the variable `text_data`, which contains bounding boxes, recognized text, and confidence scores for each detected text region.

**Processing Text Data:** It iterates over each element in `text_data`, which represents a detected text region. For each element, it extracts the bounding box (`bbox`), recognized text (`text`), and confidence score (`score`). It concatenates all the recognized text into the variable `all_text` with newline characters to separate each text.

**Drawing Bounding Boxes:** It draws rectangles around the detected text regions on the original image using OpenCV's `cv2.rectangle()` function. It also overlays the recognized text on the image using `cv2.putText()`.

**Saving Text to File:** It opens a file named "text_of_ocr.txt" in write mode and writes all the extracted text (`all_text`) into the file.

**Displaying Annotated Image:** It converts the image from BGR to RGB format (required for Matplotlib), and then displays the annotated image using Matplotlib's `imshow()` and `show()` functions.

This code demonstrates a basic OCR pipeline: detecting text regions, recognizing text, annotating the original image, and saving the extracted text to a file.
